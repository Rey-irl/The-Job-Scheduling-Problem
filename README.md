Job Shop Scheduling is an NP-hard optimization problem researched, to find an optimal sequence according number of jobs and number of machines. Additionally, the objective of the function is to minimize the maximum time in the process of jobs, this is known as Makespan. Over the years, it has been worked in applying various optimization algorithms, based on heuristics and metaheuristics, however, the two most popular have been Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm. Highlighting, the importance of the job scheduling problem due to help in the solution of activities in industries, where processes of jobs and machines, helping to the production.

Keywordsâ€”JSSP, Jobs, Machines, Greedy Algorithm, Genetic algorithm, sequence, optimal solution, makespan.
